CIRC is an IRC client packaged Chrome app. It uses the chrome.socket API to connect directly to IRC servers without the need for a proxy.

Check out the wiki for documentation and information on information on how to give feedback and submit bugs.

## Running

**Currently requires the dev channel version of Chrome, or Canary**

CIRC is not yet available on the Chrome Web Store. In the mean time you can run it from the source code. Install CoffeeScript, run "make build", and then use the "load unpackaged extention" tool in Chrome.
