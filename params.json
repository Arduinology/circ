It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"Circ","body":"CIRC is an IRC client in the form of a packaged Chrome app. That means it acts like a native application and has access to low level APIs such as chrome.socket. Here are some of the key features of CIRC:\r\n\r\n* Connect directly to any IRC server (no proxy server needed!)\r\n* Remember your nick and what channels you were last in on any device\r\n* Use the same IRC connection simultaneously on multiple devices (like Google talk)\r\n* Scripting support\r\n* Desktop notifications\r\n\r\n###Issues\r\n\r\nIf you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature, please [file an issue](https://www.github.com/noahsug/circ/issues).\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nDevelopment on CIRC has only just began! Take a look at the [changelog](https://www.github.com/noahsug/circ/wiki/changelog) to see what we've been working on with each version.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in the exciting features we have in store, check out our [development timeline] (https://www.github.com/noahsug/circ/wiki/timeline).\r\n\r\n### Scripting\r\nScripts are written in JavaScript and loaded from a file on the user's computer.\r\n\r\nTo load a script use the `/load` command, which will open a file prompt.\r\n\r\nView the [scripting docs](https://www.github.com/noahsug/circ/wiki/Scripting).\r\n\r\n### One identity\r\nYou can choose one of your devices to act as a server to which your other devices can connect. Connected devices use the IRC connection of the server device and activity is mirrored across each connected device. Whenever you install CIRC on a new device it will automatically connect to the server device. If the server is unreachable then the client use it's own connect as normal.\r\n\r\nTo use the feature use the `/make-server` command on the device you wish to use as the server. That device will remain the server even after CIRC is closed. Use `/make-server` again on a different device to change servers. The devices connect to each other using TCP sockets, so port forwarding may be required.","tagline":"An IRC packaged chrome app","google":"UA-34971629-1"}
